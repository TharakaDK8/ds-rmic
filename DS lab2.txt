This methods follows the singleton pattern.

In singleton, client(first client) calls a method and server creates an instance to serve 
the request and response it. After that instance is not destroyed. The second method call 
from the new client comes. without destroying the old instance it is used to  serve and 
responce for the new client's method call. so in there one instance serves for all client
requests.

In per call, the server creates an instance when a client calls a method(first method call).
It serves the request and sends a responce. After distroyed the instance. when the client 
calls second method it again creates a new instance and serves the request and destroy the 
instance. It means when the client calls the methods, server creates a new instance to serve 
the requests and responce for each method call destroying the previous insatnce.
